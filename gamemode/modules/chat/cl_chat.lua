LightRP was created by Rick darkalonio. LightRP was sandbox with some added RP elements.
LightRP was released at the end of January 2007

DarkRP was created as a spoof of LightRP by Rickster, somewhere during the summer of 2007.
Note: There was a DarkRP in 2006, but that was an entirely different gamemode.

Rickster went to serve his country and went to Afghanistan. During that time, the following people updated DarkRP:
Picwizdan
Sibre
[GNC] Matt
PhilXYZ
Chromebolt A.K.A. Unib5 (STEAM_0:1:19045957)

In 2008, Unib5 was administrator on a DarkRP server called EuroRP, owned by Jiggu. FPtje frequently joined this server to prop kill en masse. While Jiggu loved watching the chaos unfold, Unib5 hated it and banned FPtje on sight. Since Jiggu kept unbanning FPtje, Unib5 felt powerless. In an attempt to stop FPtje, Unib5 put FPtje's favourite prop killing props (the locker and the sawblade) in the default blacklist of DarkRP in an update. This in turn enraged FPtje, as he swore to make an update in secret that would suddenly pop up and overthrow the established version. As a result, DarkRP 2.3.1 was released in December 2008. After a bit of a fight, FPtje became the official updater of DarkRP.

    Falco A.K.A. FPtje Atheos (STEAM_0:0:8944068)
