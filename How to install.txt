Put the darkrp folder in garrysmod/gamemodes

Note: The darkrp must be full lowercase or will result in the gamemode not being found

IF YOU PUT DARKRP IN ADDONS IT WON'T WORK!

REMOVE OLD DARKRP FOLDER BEFORE PUTTING THE NEW ONE IN

DON'T change the gamemode name in Info.txt, change the folder name instead to get the satisfied result.
