MANUAL!
HOW TO USE MySQL FOR DARKRP!
Download tmysql4 and read the guide here:
https://facepunch.com/showthread.php?t=1442438


WHAT TO DO IF YOU CAN'T GET IT TO WORK!
    - There are always errors on the server, try if you can see those (with HLDS/server logs)
    - the same errors are also in the logs if you can't find the errors on the server.
        the logs are at garrysmod/data/DarkRP_logs/ on the SERVER!
        The MySQL lines in the log always precede with "MySQL Error:" (without the quotation marks)
    - make sure the settings in this file (mysql.lua) are correct
    - make sure the MySQL server is accessible from the servers IP
