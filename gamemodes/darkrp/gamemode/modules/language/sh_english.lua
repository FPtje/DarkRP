English (example) language file
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the english language file. The things on the left side of the equals sign are the things you should leave alone
The parts between the quotes are the parts you should translate. You can also copy this file and create a new language.

= Warning =
Sometimes when DarkRP is updated, new phrases are added.
If you don't translate these phrases to your language, it will use the English sentence.
To fix this, join your server, open your console and enter darkp_getphrases yourlanguage
For English the command would be:
    darkrp_getphrases "en"
because "en" is the language code for English.

You can copy the missing phrases to this file and translate them.

= Note =
Make sure the language code is right at the bottom of this file

= Using a language =
Make sure the convar gmod_language is set to your language code. You can do that in a server CFG file.
