Avoid editing DarkRP core files AT ALL COST!
DarkRP files are not meant for you to be edited, except for these files:
- shared.lua
- addentities.lua
- _MySQL.lua
- ammotypes.lua
- config.lua
- licenseweapons.lua

Anything in DarkRP should be changeable without having to change core DarkRP files.
If this isn't possible, it should be MADE possible.

Contact FPtje if there is no

How to modify DarkRP without modifying the core files
---------------------------------------------------------------------------*/
1. Go to DarkRP/gamemode/modules
2. Make a folder with any name, e.g. mydarkrpmod
	it has to be lowercase
	no spaces or weird characters
3. go into mydarkrpmod
4. if you're doing a serverside thing, make a Lua file that starts with sv_
		e.g. sv_init.lua
	if you're doing a clientside thing, make a Lua file that starts with cl_
		e.g. cl_init.lua
	if you're doing a shared thing, make a Lua file that starts with sh_
		e.g. sh_init.lua

	if you don't know what serverside/clientside/shared is, you should probably not be trying to modify DarkRP.
5. Use the DarkRP functions and hooks (and other functions/hooks) to make your thing
